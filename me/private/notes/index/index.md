# Index
The index is the root of your knowledge set in the [fractal knowledge](https://github.com/digitalreplica/fractal-knowledge) knowledge format. You can change it into anything you want, and should use it to link to your favorite notes and topcis.

## Navigation
There are many ways to navigate.
- [Backlinks](https://help.obsidian.md/Plugins/Backlinks) can follow the `in` field from the index to [[topics]] to each topic and the notes in that topic
- Notes are tagged with the `a` [nested tag](https://help.obsidian.md/Plugins/Tag+pane#Nested+tags) and the type of note.
- Folders are organized like `{owner}/{sharing level}/{repository}/{type}/{note name}`
- The [quick switcher](https://help.obsidian.md/Plugins/Quick+switcher)

See if you can use each of these methods to find `my first note`
